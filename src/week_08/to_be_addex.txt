Level 2: The Security Guard (Medium)

Level 3: The Audit Log (Hard)

Task: Add a private String history field to the User class.

Logic:

Initialize it as an empty string "".

When depositing, concatenate: history += "Deposited: " + amount + "\n";

When withdrawing, concatenate: history += "Withdrew: " + amount + "\n";

Output: Add a "5. Print History" option to your ATM menu that displays this log.
