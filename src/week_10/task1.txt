1. The "Stats Wrapper" (Arrays of Primitives)

The Scenario: A weather station collects temperature readings over a period of time.

The Requirements:

Create a class WeatherStation.

Field: double[] temperatures. -> attribute - property

Constructor: Accepts an integer size and initializes the array.

Method setTemp(int index, double val): Sets a specific reading.

Method getAverage(): Returns the average temperature.

Method getMax(): Standard algorithm to find the highest temp.

Method countAbove(double threshold): Returns how many days were hotter than the threshold.

Bear in mind:

Array Traversal (for vs for-each).
Handling empty arrays (divide by zero checks).
