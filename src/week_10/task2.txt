2. The "Aggregator" (Arrays of Objects)

The Scenario: Users can add songs to a Jukebox and play them.

The Requirements:

Class Song: Fields (Property, attribute) for title (String), artist (String), rating (int). Include a toString().

Class Jukebox:

Field: Song[] songList.

Constructor: Initializes the array to a fixed capacity (e.g., 20).

Method addSong(Song s): Finds the first null index and adds the
 song. Returns boolean (true if added, false if full).

Method playAll(): Prints the details of all songs in the list
 (Must check if (songList[i] != null) to avoid crashing!).

Method songsByArtist(String artist): Prints all songs by a specific artist.


Bear in mind:

The NullPointerException: This is the #1 error on the AP exam for object arrays.
Calling methods on objects inside an array access (e.g., songList[i].getTitle()).
