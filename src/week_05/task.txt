Automated Grader With Exceptions and Bonuses
Students ask for:
•	Student’s raw score (0–100)
•	Student’s extra credit (0–10)
•	Whether they submitted on time (Y or N)
Then compute:
•	Add extra credit only if submitted on time
•	Cap total at 100
•	Apply grade boundaries (A, B, C, D, F) with nested ifs
•	Special rules:
o	If the score is exactly 100 → “A+”
o	If the student was late but got ≥ 90 → drop one letter grade
o	If score < 50 → “F (needs major improvement)”
